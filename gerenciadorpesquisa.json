My Mondays are always busy, and I like being able to get my meals to-go with them. I usually call ahead instead of trying to order online. The only issue is they run out of the most popular menu items quickly, so be sure to call ahead! \nDate: October 8, 2018  \nLocation: Seattle, Washington\nimage1.png\n\nimage2.png\n\n",

It’s a great place to go get a cup of coffee while working on your next business idea or with friends at school. It’s also right next to the University hub, which makes it so easy to access for students. It just gets so busy on the weekends! I wish it was not so crowded. Since they started offering amazing breakfast sandwiches, I wouldn’t try to go get a coffee Saturday morning.  \nDate: September 1, 2018\nLocation: Los Angeles, California \nimage1.png\n\nimage2.png\n\n",
